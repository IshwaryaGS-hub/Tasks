    <h2>Multiplexing</h2>

    <h4>HTTP1.1</h4>
    <p>
         Uses a single connection for each request, which can lead to a phenomenon known as head-of-line
        blocking. If one resource is slow to load, it can block the loading of other resources.
    </p>

    <h4>HTTP2</h4>
    <p>
        Supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent and received in parallel
        over a single connection. This helps to overcome the head-of-line blocking issue and improves overall page
        loading speed.
    </p>

    <h2>Binary Protocol</h2>

    <h4>HTTP1.1 </h4>
    <p>
        Text-based protocol, which is human-readable but can be less efficient in terms of parsing and
        processing.
    </p>
    <h4>HTTP2</h4> 
    <p>
     Binary protocol, which is more efficient for machines to parse and results in faster processing.
   </p>

<h2>Resource Prioritization</h2>

    <h4>HTTP1.1</h4>
    <p> 
        No built-in support for prioritizing resources. All resources are treated equally.
    </p>
    <h4>HTTP2</h4>
    <p>
        Supports resource prioritization, allowing the server to specify the importance of different
        resources. This helps in loading critical resources first, improving page rendering speed.

    <h1>Objects</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data type that allows you to store and organize data using key-value
        pairs.
       </li> 
        <li>
            Objects can represent complex entities and are central to the language's flexibility and expressiveness.
        </li>
       <li> 
          When it comes to their internal representations, understanding how JavaScript handles objects is crucial for
        efficient programming.
       </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Internal Representations</h1>
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>
        Objects in JavaScript consist of properties, where each property has a key and a corresponding value. The key is
        always a string or a symbol, and the value can be of any data type, including other objects.
    </p>
    <h3>Prototypes</h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other
        objects through a prototype chain. If a property or method is not found on an object, JavaScript looks for it in
        the object's prototype, and so on, until the end of the chain.
